❌ Bad Code:\n`javascript\nfunction sum(){return a+b;}\n`\n\n🔍 Issues:\n* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` if `a` and `b` are not defined in the outer scope (e.g., global scope), or it will use the values from the outer scope, making the function's behavior unpredictable.\n* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, limiting its reusability. A sum function should generally accept the numbers to sum as arguments.\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n`javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n`\n\n💡 Improvements:\n* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as arguments, making it more versatile and predictable.\n* ✔️ The function is now self-contained and doesn't rely on variables defined outside of its scope.\n\nFinal Note:\nAlways define what your function needs to do its work. Relying on external context is bad practice as it makes the function hard to debug and reuse. If you don't provide variables to work with, the function has no idea what to use and thus will result in unintended results.
